The wiki's ultimate goal is to build a place where Blue Archive lore can be easily navigated through and accessed. The frontend mirrors that decision and hence built upon that foundation. It provides the maximum ease-of-access with no tradeoffs for modern looks and readability, thanks to its sidebar, where all the lore lives inside.

## Contributing to the Lore Archive frontend

Even though I call it a "Lore Archive Frontend", you must remember that the Lore Archive is a wiki powered by [DokuWiki](https://dokuwiki.org) at its core. Therefore, this frontend is inevitably a DokuWiki [Template](https://www.dokuwiki.org/template). Many PHP functions provided by DokuWiki (DokuWiki core functions) are throughout the files, and they have short, inline comments to describe their use (if not, wait until they do. I am still adding them).

To further read how the system works, read the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
