# Contributing to the Lore Archive Wiki (LAW)
## Prerequisites
To effectively contribute to the frontend code, it is recommended you are familiar with the **HTML** and **CSS** syntax and workflow. PHP is not required _per se_, but it can make your time contributing a whole lot less confusing. Javascript knowledge is not _required_. Just like myself. I can't code JS for ****.
